This example uses the Adafruit_DHT library and it will need to be installed from source. 

### Installation of module
`sudo pip install Adafruit_DHT`

That should do it, if you run in to problems installing this module, or would rather install it from source, see the Adafruit Repository:

Thanks Adafruit!
